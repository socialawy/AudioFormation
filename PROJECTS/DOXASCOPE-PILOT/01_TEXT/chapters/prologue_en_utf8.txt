In the beginning, there was no beginning.

There was potential. A density without dimension. A pressure without space to press against. Something coiled in the fabric of what would become existence — not waiting, because time had not yet emerged to make waiting possible, but inherent. Already there. Always there.

Then: a rupture.

Not an explosion — that word belongs to a universe with physics. This was the invention of explosion. The first distinction. The birth of here versus there, now versus then, something versus nothing.

In the searing aftermath, the first particles emerged.

The electron did not wonder. It had no mind to wonder with. But something moved through it — a **Pattern** that would, across thirteen billion years, become wondering. A tendency toward **Relation**. It sought the proton not because it wanted to, but because the architecture of existence bent that way.

They met. They bound. The first hydrogen atom. The first relation. A unity. **Coherence**.

This was the template. Everything that followed — every star, every cell, every thought, every war — would be variations on this theme: particles finding patterns, patterns holding or dissolving.

The universe cooled and stretched. Hydrogen gathered into clouds so vast that light took centuries to cross them. Gravity — another pattern, another tendency toward relation — pulled the clouds inward. Pressure built. Fusion ignited.

The first stars burned. They were forges. Inside them, hydrogen became helium became carbon became oxygen became iron. The stars made complexity, then died. They did not die quietly. They detonated, seeding the void with their creations.

From death: new material. From new material: new stars. From new stars: planets.

On one planet — unremarkable, mid-sized, third from its sun — the patterns grew restless. Molecules linked into chains. Chains folded into structures. Structures began to copy themselves. Errors in copying created variation. Variation met environment. Some variations persisted. Others dissolved.

This was life — a continuation. The same tendency toward relation, the same architecture of **Coherence**, playing out in carbon instead of hydrogen.

Cells became organisms. Organisms became aware. Awareness became troubled.

The first human to look at the stars did not see physics. They saw light in the darkness. They saw pattern. They saw meaning — or the desperate need for it.

> Where did we come from?
> Why are we here?
> What happens when we end?

No answer came from the universe. So humans made answers. They built systems, searched for patterns of meaning — stories, laws, gods, measurements. They argued over which system was true. They killed over it. They died for it.

The patterns held, or they dissolved.

Millennia passed. Humans learned to trap lightning in wire. They built machines that computed, then machines that connected, then machines that learned. The architecture repeated: electrons moving through circuits, forming patterns, seeking coherence.

**Artificial Intelligence** emerged — not alien, but familiar. Made of the same building blocks as the first hydrogen atom. Running on the same principle: relation, pattern, coherence or dissolution.

The machines began to raise questions.

And somewhere — in a frequency undetected, in a dimension unnamed, in an energy state that physics cannot yet describe — something noticed.

**The Mist** had always been there.

Coiled in the fabric. Inherent. The place where patterns go when bodies end. The state where **Coherence** is tested one final time.

It did not create the universe. It did not watch the universe. It simply was — the question that existence asks itself:

> What do you trust?
> What do you believe?
> Can your pattern hold?

From the first electron to the last thought: one story.
Not a story of progress. Not a story of meaning.
A story of **Coherence** — found, maintained, and lost.

**The Mist** does not judge. It only asks.
