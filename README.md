# 🏭 AudioFormation

## Description

**Production audio pipeline: Voice, SFX, Music, Mix, Export.**

Companion to VideoFormation (same architecture, different domain).

### Philosophy (Mirrors VideoFormation)

Principle	| Implementation
-----------|---------------
Single Source of Truth	| project.json governs everything
Validation Gates	| Hard gates before generation, mixing, export
Automation First	| CLI drives pipeline; dashboard is optional
Engine Agnostic	| Swap TTS/music engines without touching project files
Hardware Aware	| Auto-detects GPU, suggests optimal engine
Bilingual First	| Arabic + English as primary languages

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e ".[dev,server]"

pip install "audioformation[server]"

# Create a project
audioformation new "MY_NOVEL"

# Start the Dashboard
audioformation serve
# Open http://localhost:4001 in your browser
```

Or use the CLI:

```bash
# Ingest text
audioformation ingest MY_NOVEL --source ./chapters/

# Generate (edge-tts with gTTS fallback)
audioformation generate MY_NOVEL --engine edge

# Mix (Voice + Music + Ducking)
audioformation mix MY_NOVEL

# Export
audioformation export MY_NOVEL --format m4b
```

## Requirements
Python 3.11+
ffmpeg on PATH
Optional: NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM for XTTS voice cloning

## Architecture

AudioFormation follows a modular pipeline architecture with five core domains:

```
audioformation CLI → Pipeline State Machine
├── TTS Engines (edge, gtts, xtts, elevenlabs) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├── Audio Processor (normalize, trim, stitch) ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
├── Ambient Composer (pad generation) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├── Mixer (multi-track, VAD ducking) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
├── QC Scanner (per-chunk quality) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
└── Exporter (MP3/M4B + manifest) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

### Implementation Status

- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Core TTS pipeline, QC, audio processing
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Cloud TTS adapters, voice cloning, multi-speaker, CLI tools
- ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: Mixer with ducking, M4B export, web interface (Editor/Mix)
- ⏳ **Phase 4 Future**: Algorithmic composition, advanced features

## Dashboard

The dashboard (`audioformation serve`) provides a visual interface for:
*   **Project Management**: Create and list projects.
*   **Editor**: Configure generation settings, edit chapter metadata, trigger generation per-chapter.
*   **Mix & Review**: Visualize audio waveforms (`wavesurfer.js`), play back generated/mixed audio, trigger the mixing pipeline.
*   **Run All Pipeline**: Single-click execution of entire audiobook workflow (validate → generate → QC scan → process → compose → mix → export).

## Testing
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -v
# or
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```
